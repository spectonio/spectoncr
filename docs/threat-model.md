# SpectonCR Threat Model

## 1. System Overview

SpectonCR is a cloud-native OCI-compliant container image registry built in Rust, providing multi-tenant isolation and zero-trust authentication. The system consists of two primary services and a pluggable storage backend.

### 1.1 Components

| Component         | Description                                          | Port |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------|
| specton-registry   | OCI Distribution API (Docker Registry HTTP API V2)   | 5000 |
| specton-auth       | Token issuance, OIDC validation, RBAC enforcement    | 5001 |
| Storage backend   | Blob/manifest persistence (filesystem, S3, GCS, Azure) | N/A |

```

**Trust boundary 1: External network to cluster ingress.** All client traffic crosses this boundary. TLS termination occurs here.

**Trust boundary 2: Auth service to OIDC provider.** Outbound HTTPS to validate identity tokens against the provider's JWKS endpoint.

**Trust boundary 3: Registry to storage backend.** The registry writes and reads blobs/manifests. Storage credentials are a high-value target.

**Trust boundary 4: Between tenants.** Logical isolation within the same service instance. A failure here has the highest blast radius.

## 2. Threat Actors

### 2.1 External Attacker

**Profile:** An unauthenticated adversary with network access to the registry or auth endpoints.

**Goals:**
- Pull private images to steal proprietary code or secrets embedded in layers
- Push malicious images to poison the supply chain
- Denial of service against the registry
- Credential harvesting via brute force or token theft

**Capabilities:** Can send arbitrary HTTP requests, may have access to public OIDC providers, can rotate source IPs.

### 2.2 Malicious Tenant

**Profile:** An authenticated user with a valid tenant who attempts to exceed their authorized scope.

**Goals:**
- Access images belonging to another tenant (cross-tenant data breach)
- Escalate privileges from Reader to Admin
- Exhaust shared resources (storage, compute) to impact other tenants
- Exfiltrate data from the storage backend via path traversal

**Capabilities:** Has valid OIDC credentials, can request tokens, can push/pull within their tenant.

### 2.3 Compromised CI/CD Pipeline

**Profile:** A CI/CD system whose credentials or OIDC trust has been abused.

**Goals:**
- Push tampered images to replace legitimate artifacts
- Use the compromised identity to pivot to other tenants
- Persist access beyond the pipeline execution window
- Exfiltrate secrets from the registry or auth service

**Capabilities:** Has a valid OIDC identity token, may have push scope, runs automated workloads.

### 2.4 Malicious Insider

**Profile:** An operator or developer with administrative access to the infrastructure.

**Goals:**
- Extract signing keys to forge tokens
- Modify access policies to grant unauthorized access
- Tamper with audit logs to cover tracks
- Access storage backend directly, bypassing the registry

**Capabilities:** May have SSH access, Kubernetes admin, or cloud IAM roles.

## 4. Mitigations Implemented

### 4.1 Authentication Layer

1. **OIDC JWT validation** with signature verification against provider JWKS endpoints.
2. **Algorithm pinning** to RS256/EdDSA -- `none` and symmetric algorithms are rejected.
3. **Short-lived tokens** (default 300 seconds) with no refresh mechanism.
4. **Constant-time password comparison** for bootstrap admin to prevent timing attacks.
5. **Rate limiting** on token issuance (per-tenant, configurable RPM).

### 4.2 Authorization Layer

1. **Server-side role resolution** -- the client cannot request a role; it is derived from access policies.
2. **Scope intersection** -- issued token scopes are the intersection of requested and permitted actions.
3. **Tenant isolation** -- every operation is scoped to the token's tenant ID; cross-tenant access is structurally impossible in the scope model.
4. **Project-scoped policies** take precedence over tenant-wide policies.

### 4.3 Data Protection

1. **Content-addressable storage** -- blobs are stored by digest, preventing tampering.
2. **Digest verification** on upload -- pushed content must match its declared digest.
3. **Storage prefix isolation** -- each tenant's data lives under a unique prefix.
4. **No credentials in logs** -- tokens, passwords, and Authorization headers are never logged.

### 4.4 Operational Security

1. **Non-root container** -- the service runs as UID 10001.
2. **Minimal base image** -- debian-slim with no unnecessary packages.
3. **Structured JSON logging** with request IDs for full traceability.
4. **Prometheus metrics** for monitoring authentication failures, rate limits, and request patterns.
5. **Health check endpoints** for liveness and readiness probing.

## 5. Residual Risks

These are known risks that are accepted or require external mitigation.

### 5.1 Accepted Risks

| Risk                                            | Severity | Rationale                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-memory signing key (no HSM)                  | Medium   | HSM integration adds significant complexity; mitigated by non-root user, restricted file permissions, and key rotation |
| Single-process token issuance (no quorum)       | Medium   | Acceptable for most deployments; HA is achieved via horizontal scaling behind a load balancer |
| OIDC provider availability dependency           | Medium   | If the OIDC provider is down, no new tokens can be issued; existing tokens remain valid until expiry |
| Tag mutability (default)                         | Low      | Tag immutability is configurable per project; mutable tags are the Docker ecosystem default |

### 5.2 Risks Requiring External Mitigation

| Risk                                            | Severity | Required External Control                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TLS termination                                 | Critical | Deploy behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or ingress controller       |
| Storage backend access control                  | Critical | Configure cloud IAM to restrict storage access to the registry service account only |
| Network segmentation                            | High     | Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies or cloud VPC rules to restrict traffic     |
| Log tampering                                   | Medium   | Ship logs to an immutable, centralized logging system (e.g., Loki, CloudWatch) |
| DDoS protection                                 | High     | Use a cloud WAF or DDoS mitigation service in front of the registry      |
| Signing key backup and recovery                 | High     | Store key backups in a secrets manager with access audit trail            |

### 5.3 Future Improvements

1. **JWKS caching with background refresh** to reduce latency and OIDC provider dependency.
2. **Token revocation list (JTI blacklist)** for emergency token invalidation.
3. **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** between auth and registry services.
4. **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** integration for signing key protection.
5. **Content trust / Notation integration** for mandatory image signing.
6. **Per-tenant storage quotas** with enforcement at the registry layer.
7. **Audit log streaming** to an external SIEM.
